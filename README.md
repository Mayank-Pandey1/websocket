### 📡 websocket
A project demonstrating real-time web communication between a server and clients using WebSockets, built with Node.js, Express, and likely Socket.IO. This repository offers both server-side and client-side code for experimenting with real-time messaging.

####🚀 Features
1- Real-time bidirectional communication
2- Node.js + Express backend
3- Socket.IO integration (inferred from repo structure)
4- Separate client and server folders
5- Easy to run locally for experimentation
6- Educational example for beginners

server/	Server-side source code (Express, Socket.IO app)
client/	Client-side code (frontend app)

🏁 Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
Node.js (v14+ recommended)

NPM (comes with Node.js)

2. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies for both server and client:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/Mayank-Pandey1/websocket.git
cd websocket
cd server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

3. Running the Server
bash
```
cd server
npm start
```
The server should now be running, usually at http://localhost:3000.

5. Running the Client

bash
```
cd client
npm start
```
Open your browser at the client app’s URL (often http://localhost:3001 or specified in client config).

7. Demo
Open the client app in multiple browser tabs or devices.

Connects to the server via WebSocket.

Try sending messages/events; all clients will see the updates in real-time.
